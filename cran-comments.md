title: CRAN package coreheat
---

## Resubmission 2021-09-17
This is resubmission of the package. The version was increased to 0.2.2 after addressing the comments by CRAN member Gregor Seyer:  

* replaced `cat` with `message` to make verbose output be suppressable
* added argument `verbose` defaulting to `FALSE` for convenience
* The word "Ensembl" is not misspelled but refers to the Ensembl project. It is used, e.g., in the DESCRIPTION of the `biomaRt` package.  

In addition, the following corrections/additions were made:  

* extended correlation map filtering capabilities
* fixed and now exporting function to automatically split clusters based on noise level and hierarchy for filtering
* added argument controlling plot sub-title
* corrected bug and fixed behavior when input is a correlation matrix
* adapted some defaults
* minor corrections to documentation (misspelled words etc)

## Resubmission 2021-09-03
This is resubmission of the package. The version was increased to 0.2.1 after checking and slightly modifying the vignette to address the re-building error given in the __win-builder Debian__ check:

```
Error(s) in re-building vignettes:
  ...
--- re-building ‘coreheat-vignette.Rmd’ using rmarkdown
Quitting from lines 110-111 (coreheat-vignette.Rmd) 
Error: processing vignette 'coreheat-vignette.Rmd' failed with diagnostics:
Values argument contains no data.
--- failed re-building ‘coreheat-vignette.Rmd’
```

Please note that I could not reproduce the error on any of the test systems. I do not have a Debian system, I tested on a Docker image running Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS.
